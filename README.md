**IBM Predictive Modeling and Regression Analysis Project**
**Project Overview**
This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to analyze and predict house prices. The tasks include cleaning data, transforming features, and applying Ridge regression to evaluate the performance of the model.

**Project Tasks**

Data Preparation and Cleaning
**Drop Unnecessary Columns:** Removed columns such as id and Unnamed: 0 that are not needed for analysis.
**Handle Missing Values:** Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values.
**Display Data Types:** Displayed the data types of each column to understand the dataset structure.
**Find Unique Values:** Identified unique values in relevant columns to ensure data consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Count Number of Houses:** Used value_counts to count the number of houses based on attributes like waterfront.
**Summary Statistics:** Generated summary statistics to understand the distribution and characteristics of numerical features.

**Polynomial Feature Transformation and Ridge Regression**
**Polynomial Feature Transformation:** Applied a second-order polynomial transformation to capture non-linear relationships between features.
**Ridge Regression:** Created and fitted a Ridge regression model with a regularization parameter of 0.1 to predict house prices. Evaluated model performance using the R² score on the test data.

**Results**
R² Value: The R² value of the Ridge regression model on the test data is provided in the code outputs.

**Conclusions**
Data preparation and cleaning steps ensure that the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.
EDA provides insights into the dataset’s characteristics and distributions, which help in understanding the data better.
The Ridge regression model, combined with polynomial features, helps in understanding the relationships between features and the target variable. The R² value indicates the effectiveness of the model in explaining the variance in house prices.
